  <p><b>The 16 Personality Test</b>
  <br>My result from the 16 Personalities test classified me as an &apos;Assertive Executive&apos;. The key values of this personality type are honesty, dedication and dignity. We give concise advice and guidance and are always putting our hands up to happily lead the way on difficult paths. We are known for organising, working hard and bringing people together. Our strengths include being strong-willed, direct, loyal, reliable and excellent organisers.
  <br>Shortcomings for this personality type include being inflexible and stubborn, uncomfortable with unconventional situations and can also find it difficult to relax. Executives project natural authority and take genuine pleasure in organising others into effective teams which makes this particular personality well suited for managerial positions where creating order, following the rules and ensuring high standards come naturally.</p>

  <p><b>The Study Style Test</b>
  <br>My result from my learning style assessment showed I was a Kinesthetic learner. Meaning, I learn best when I can use my sense of touch.  The website recommended the following suggestions to assist with study:
<div class="left">
  <li> Be physically active while you study. Occasionally walk back and forth with your notes and read out loud.
  <li> Listen to music, preferably baroque, classical or jazz
  <li> Make extensive use of a computer and the Internet. Actively touching the keyboard will keep your mind active.

    <p><b>The Big Five Personality Test</b>
    <br>The test results are accurate and align nicely with my other results from the 16 Personalities Test. It states as follows:

    <p>Openness: 77%
    <br>Conscientiousness: 85%
    <br>Extraversion: 94%
    <br>Agreeableness: 52%
    <br>Neuroticism: 31%

    <p>With my highest scoring personality traits being extraversion, conscientiousness and openness it demonstrates a very similar result to that of my 16 personalities test.
    <br>High scores in these three particular traits describe a person who hold the ability to think in abstract, complex and more creative ways while also exercising self-discipline in order to pursue goals.
    <br>Extraversion describes a person&apos;s gravitation to seek stimulation from external sources but in particular, in the form of attention from other people.  These are results that I definitely agree with, I don&apos;t this these results will influence my behaviour. I am aware of my personality and while I feel the results are roughly accurate they aren&apos;t absolute. Although I don&apos;t believe that the results will effect me personally, I can see how someone who, for example, perhaps scored lower in extraversion trait may try and push themselves to be a little more extraverted in an effort to achieve a better level of engagement with the rest of the group and in their day to day life.</p>

    <p>Results such as these are more useful for one&apos;s own awareness rather than trying to catergorise others. I wouldn't lean on them when trying to assemble a team or find compatible friends. Personality tests are very general. They don&apos;t take into account any other factors of one&apos;s personality, therefore, it wouldn&apos;t be constructive to depend heavily on their evaluations.
    <br>While you wouldn&apos;t want to select a team based of similar personalities as you won&apos;t get a diverse range of opinions and similarly - you don&apos;t want opposite opinions as you can clash therefore I would only ever find it useful to read my own results as a way of bettering myself.</p>
