<div class="main">
  <br>My project idea is an app that targets consumers looking to either fix up their existing garden, or those wanting to create a garden based on their desired style.  The app is designed to help those who have little to no prior experience working in gardens, this is something that I have found when speaking to friends about their backyards. A lot of money can be wasted by selecting a plant that isn&apos;t compatible for the space in which you&apos;d like to plant it in. This app is created to educate, help and save users money and time in the process of designing their dream garden. </br>

  <br>My motivation behind designing this particular app comes from personal experiences of myself and those around me. Whether you have an apartment or a house with a backyard, everyone can benefit from having plants, indoor or out. Not only can plants help with reducing stress levels, but they can also be therapeutic to upkeep and manage, particularly for those who suffer from anxiety, depression or dementia. Plants are also proved to boost productivity through multiple studies (Links to these studies are provided on the right). In the current climate with a spike in people working from home, adding plants to your space can help with creative thinking, concentration and attentiveness.</br>

  <br>Once downloaded and opened, the app will ask the user if they&apos;re currently living in an apartment or a house and then whether they are looking to design a garden indoors or out. Once the user has selected this information the app will the show a &apos;Home&apos; page. This page will consist of a list of buttons ie. &apos;Home&apos;, &apos;Design&apos;, &apos;Garden Inspirations&apos;, &apos;Plant Health&apos;, &apos;Plant Suppliers&apos;, &apos;Greenthumbs of the Month&apos;, &apos;Plant a Question&apos;. </br>

  <p><b>Design -</b> This button is for the users to select when they are ready to scan and design. Once clicked, the app will open a camera and want to scan the area the user wants to work on. Once scanned, the app will then ask a series of questions needed to make accurate suggestions for plants. <q>How deep is the soil?</q> <q>Do you have any pets?</q> <q>On a scale of 1 to 5, how much maintenance are you wanting your garden to require?</q>. Following the questions the user can then select a garden style (which they will have researched independently or through our &apos;Garden Inspirations&apos; feature.
    <br>Once the app has all the necessary information, it will then suggest a rough render of suggested plants and their placements before asking you if you&apos;d like to edit. If the user would like to edit, there will be a list of plants recommended on the right hand side of the app that the user can drag and place on top of the scan. If they&apos;d like to remove a plant, they can click it and a small &apos;x&apos; will appear to delete. After the editing phase, the user can then continue to locate their plants. The next step is to take the user to a &apos;Plant Supplier&apos; page. Here, the user can see the recommended plants and where each one is able to be purchased from.  The suppliers will primarily be wholesale nurseries with lower prices than your regular retail stores. The user will then have the option of picking up or selecting delivery (if their postcode is eligible). Users can also purchase gardening equipment if required for installation.</br>
<p><b>Garden Inspirations - </b>This is a Pinterest-inspired collection of photos showing different garden styles. This section is to help the user figure out what style garden they are wanting to implement in their home. This could be Japanese-style, Traditional, Mediterranean, Cottage/ Meadow, Costal etc. The user can like photos and save it to a folder that they can later refer back to.
<p><b>Plant Health - </b>This is for users to search for plants they own, locate symptoms of a sick plant as well as remedies to treat. Each plant will also have a list of requirements for a healthy plant ie. Amount of sun, water, shade.
<p><b>Plant Suppliers - </b>As mentioned, this page is a list of all suppliers that have partnered with the app. They are mainly wholesale nurseries who offer delivery to limited postcodes depending on location.
<p><b>Greenthumbs of the Month - </b>The app will encourage users to take photos and share them on the app. On a monthly basis, a competition will be run, 5 users with the best gardens will win vouchers (either to the wholesale supplier or in gardening equipment) and their photos will be published on this section of the app.
<p><b>Plant a question/ Submit a GTOM entry - </b>This feature of the app is for those who need assistance in navigating the app as well as general customer service. This is also the space in which users can submit entries for the monthly competition. They can upload and send images to our customer service team who will forward the photos on for deliberation. It is a chat-box that connects you to a real customer service consultant. Their responsibilities will cover:
  <div class="main a">
- Helping users with account/ payment queries
  <br>- Liaising delivery updates between the suppliers and customers
  <br>- Accepting &apos;Greenthumbs of the month&apos; photos
  <br>- Helping with horticulturist related questions
  <br>- Organising prizes to be sent out to competition winners
</div>
<i>(Note: all customer service representatives will require either a keen knowledge or an educational background in horticulture or agriculture)</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  <p>Users will require a handheld device with a built in camera, the ability to download applications as well as an internet connection whether it be via a phone network or wifi, a smartphone or a tablet. Other equipment users will need, although it's not essential  before downloading, is gardening equipment. The option of purchasing equipment prior to checkout is available and will of course require a debit or credit card to finalise their order.

  <p>Skills required to bring my project to life mainly is the ability to create app software. I will need someone who is comfortable writing software for an app that is installable for both Apple and Android users. I will also need a graphic designer with the skills to design a user friendly app that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. With my demographic being men and women between the ages of 25-40 years old, I require the app the be well designed from both a UX and a creative perspective.

  <p>If my app is successful, users will be happier in their spaces, they will also have healthier air to breathe. If working from home it can boost their productivity and efficiency. For those who are older or who suffer from emotional conditions, tending to plants can help keep the mind active, reduce stress and lower their blood pressure. From an environmental standpoint, essentially you're installing an ecosystem. This attracts insects and birds which can help boost the ecosystem.
  Monetarily, our users will reduce, if not stop, the cost of unnecessary and unsuitable pants that die due to being placed/positioned incorrectly. We also provide a more cost effective avenue for users to purchase their plants through a wholesaler opposed to a large retail chain such as Bunnings.

  <p>Overall, the app is designed to better user's spaces and encourage them to invest in a green hobby that not only benefits their mind and lifestyles but it also is environmentally beneficial.
